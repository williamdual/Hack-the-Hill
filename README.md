Our submission for Hack the Hill 2023.

  Sewer Savoir is a unique approach to the classic “bullet-hell” genre that has you
  attempting to save the local water way while surviving it. Your sewer has been backed
  up with trash, this has mutated the local fish population and is causing water levels to
  rise. As the Sewer Savoir you are tasked with surviving an onslaught from the fish and
  their angler king as you dislodge trash in an attempt to clean the waterway.
</p>

  Sewer Savoir tackles actual real life environmental issues like rising water levels,
  water pollution, and flooding. Antithetical to how normal bullet hell games are played,
  you are not supposed to destroy the attacking characters, but save them. The cause of
  the problem is also man made, trash. This mirrors the reality of real life pollution, its
  humanity's fault and its a problem solved through healing, not more destruction.

  This game is intended for children, using a fishing rod to pull up trash and bring
  fish to cleaner waters, is a good stand in for real life large scale clean up and
  conservation efforts. The purpose of this in the real world is the same as your primary
  objective in the game, survival through helping the environment.
